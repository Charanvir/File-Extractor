## Description

The File Extractor application is a tool that can select a archive file (.zip) file and select a destination somewhere
on your local machine. Once you click the Extract button and execute the application, it will extract all the files
from the archive file selected and place them in the destination folder selected. This application is currently only
usable on macOS operating systems.

### Dependencies

This application was made using Python and a number of third party and standard modules. This application uses
PySimpleGUI to create the visual user interface. It also uses the zipfile standard python module to execute the
extracting functionality.

## Installation

To install this application to your Mac, simply clone or download the repository files on to your local machine. This
will create a folder which contains the application file.

## Usage

There are two primary ways to use this application. The easiest way is to run the standalone executable application
file. This will be an application file found in the project directory called File Extractor App. This will open the user
interface for this application.

The other way to run this application on your local machine is to run it via the command line. This requires Python3 to
be installed on your local machine. Once you clone, or download, the project repository onto your local machine.
Navigate to the root directory of the project via the command line and run the following command:

```commandline
python3 main.py
```

This will run the command via your command line and will allow you to use the application just as if you are executing
the standalone application.
